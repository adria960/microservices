DockerHub - browser (my laptop):
docker0407/docker123


1. Every service has Dockerfile 

2. All done in Spring Boot

3. Build image from Dockerfile - 

4. Create docker-compose.yml file with all services
   - microservices - poduct stock and enquiry, eureka and api-gateway
   - prometheus -
	volumes - need to have reference for the config file 
	image from docker hub; 
	needs config file (mandatory). There is also default file

   - grafana
	image from docker hub
        loaded after prometheus

   - zipkin
	image from docker hub
	environment is set to STORAGE_TYPE=mem    inMemory, could be MySQL or...dbase other
   

After compose it will create Logical volume on my machine

Prometeus and Graphana run within containers configured on my machine!!!
