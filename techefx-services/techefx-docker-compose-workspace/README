prometheus.yml

scrape
evalution   every 5 sec results collected

Then, create job for the services.
scrape-interval will overwrite the upper settings

What you want to monitor, put into job.

  - job_name: 'Stock-service'
    scrape_interval: 5s
    metrics_path: '/actuator/prometheus'
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['techefx-product-stock-service:8800']
Enable actuator in services (product stock) - dependancy, application.yml:
management.endpoints.web.exposure.include="*" and
management.endpoints.health.show-details=always

      - targets: ['techefx-product-stock-service:8800'] - Docker understands that  NOT localhost, only the service name.
