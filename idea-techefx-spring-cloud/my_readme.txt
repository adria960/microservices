Write Microservices In Spring Boot & Spring Cloud, Microservices Live Example & Source Code

==========================================================================================================

In this session, we explore spring boot and spring cloud microservice architecture. I assume, you already have basic knowledge of RESTful API development. 

We would write & configure following spring cloud components :
1. Spring Cloud Config Server
2. Netflix Eureka Naming and Discovery server
3. Spring Cloud API Gateway Server
4. Netflix Ribbon Load Balancer
6. Zuul API Gateway Proxy
7. Open Feign Api to Api Communication
8. Zipkin Distributed Tracking with Sleuth and Rabbit MQ

To Demonstrate all the above component's functionality, we would write primarily our own microservices mentioned below:
1. Property Access Service
2. Product Stock Service 
3. Product Enquiry Service

1. Eureka Naming and Discovery server - PORTS IP address all services
2. Cloud Config Server - central place external properties to run for config
3. Ribbon - Load Balancer - balance the load

4. Zuul dynamic routing
5. 		nonblocking gateway - 

6. Zipkin - logging uses Sleuth generate and trace logs 
 ActiveMQ - Streams logs (for Zippkin)
 
 Actuator - for monitor ms
 OpenFeign - ApI to API
 ErrorHandling
 Swagger for API
